# Generating Landscape pictures with DCGAN
This repository consists of generating images using DCGAN, model was trained using the [Landscape Pictures](https://www.kaggle.com/arnaud58/landscape-pictures) dataset from kaggle, in This repo you can find two notebooks:
* **Model - 28X28.ipynb** which generates images of size (28,28), the same notebook can be found on Google Colab by clicking on this [Link](). Generated Samples are in the following picture.

* **Model - 64X64.ipynb** which generates images of size (64,64), the same notebook can be found on Google Colab by clicking on this [Link](). Generated samples are in the following picture.

In order to run this code on Colab, you need to download your kaggle.json file from the [Kaggle]((https://www.kaggle.com/) Webiste, save it in your Google Drive, and change the path of this file in the Section "Prepare Kaggle CLI" in the notebook.
